# django_moviereviews
A simple movie reviews site built using Django. This is built using the examples in Django 4 for the Impatient: https://www.packtpub.com/product/django-4-for-the-impatient/9781803245836

I've really done this just to prove I could get through the whole book in a 24 hour period and to refresh my base knowledge on how Django works.

The deployment chapter has been skipped - opting to do this later with real projects.
